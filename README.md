## About Me

Hey there! I'm Elliot, and I'm a database enthusiast who loves to read and explore the latest research in this field. When I'm not tinkering with databases or trying out new programming languages like C++ and Rust, I enjoy writing articles on various topics related to computer science and technology.

## Tech Stack

Here are a few technologies I've been working with recently:

- Databases: MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, MongoDB, Redis
- Programming languages: Go, C++, Rust, SQL
- Technologies: Docker, Git, AWS

## Research Papers

I love reading about the latest advancements in database research. Here are some recent papers that I found interesting:

- [Google Spanner: Google's Globally Distributed Database](https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en//archive/spanner-osdi2012.pdf)
- [5-Minute Rule for Trading Memory for Disk Accesses and the Case for Commodity SSDs](https://www.usenix.org/conference/fast11/technical-sessions/presentation/jiang)

## Projects
